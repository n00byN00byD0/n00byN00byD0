- 👋 Hi, I’m @n00byN00byD0
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a full stack developer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning UML, SQL, Vert.x.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Java Server code - (under instruction!).
- 📫 How to reach me n00byN00byD0@pm.me
- 😄 Pronouns: [KISS or surprise me! ❤️‍🔥]
- ⚡ Fun fact: Winning is enjoyable.
- 🤞 So is: the pursuit.

(AS long AS the difficulty level is balanced)

      Good code takes lot's of skill.
      Truly evil code does too.
      
      Unfortunately 😬 the "eye of Sauron" could be realised; in an,
      only **slightly** different form, soon. (--(just Google it!)--)
      
      Where heroes die alone, noobs die en masse.
      Underestimation is easy (as any noob will tell you) -
      I'm guessing: %50 of young people should survive for 1000yrs 🤔.
      So no pressure, as we reach a singularity event that will,
      largely shape said 1000yrs + (as good as) forever.

## Futures<?> NEED YOU!!! 🫵 [at least consider that the request is made]

        If you are weak I'll be weaker for it,
            -I'd like to be meek for a while.
