- 👋 Hi, I’m @n00byN00byD0
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a full stack developer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning UML, SQL, Vert.x.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Java Server code - (under instruction!).
- 📫 How to reach me n00byN00byD0@pm.me
- 😄 Pronouns: [KISS or surprise me! ❤️‍🔥]
- ⚡ Fun fact: Nothing is as pure a concept as can be.

Hola! Hello!

A few extra factoids relating to communication here:

NOTHING is PERFECTLY-easy to PERFECTLY understand (in ANY situation) ->  __THUS__ ------>   !! GONE !!    (if you don't believe me feel free to point out where nothing is now)
as all references, in actuality |-/ /-| [&(really) from nothing] are actually [real] OBSERVATIONS OR IDEAS (good + bad, ARE YOURS --- well articulated [should be] pooled and [reflected on / rememberd])


UNFORTUNATELY, understanding nothing (or even JUST NOT ENOUGH) of __ANYTHING__
THAT IS __SIGNIFICANT__ like NATURES[<-strong-link-with->]NOTHING ... in particular, (without the sound refrences TO something OR (considerate, decent people) can cause SERIOUS LOSS) 




as nothing but that 

form without a significant measure 
               2) Nothing can negate nothing because, nothing is negatable with nothing to negate.
               3) Nothing allows us to reliably change nothing in observance of nature nothing does not exist 

with the purity of nothing as o only the and reality through observation, very much in a pure action the nature of observation


the experience's reality in the reality of it our nature locked in our deepest thoughtsphilosphicaly in the absence in our deepest thought through will
grasping an understanding without flexing ouselves
regarding lines of thought as but the effort to reframe our own


Good code takes skill.
Powerful code does too.

Unfortunately the "Eye of Sauron",
   -a resonating fiction of a pure magical evil -J. R. R. Tolkien
Seems to have aproximately manifested in and into Google.
