„Ç§„Éé„Çª„É≥„Çπ   ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî• [N]othing is as pure a concept any,

A gift of nothing is time and space to grant a moments freedom,

Nearly 45 years of life has gone from since before I was a child,

All that has got this far burns faster than time itself,

I am here to offer nothing up,

NOTHING is PERFECTLY-easy to PERFECTLY understand (in ANY situation) ->  __THUS__ ------>   !! GONE !!    (if you don't believe me feel free to point out where nothing is now)
as all references, in actuality |-/ /-| [&(really) from nothing] are actually [real] OBSERVATIONS OR IDEAS (good + bad, ARE YOURS --- well articulated [should be] pooled and [reflected on / rememberd])


UNFORTUNATELY, understanding nothing (or even JUST NOT ENOUGH) of __ANYTHING__
THAT IS __SIGNIFICANT__ like NATURES[<-strong-link-with->]NOTHING ... in particular, (without the sound refrences TO something OR (considerate, decent people) can cause SERIOUS LOSS) 
Nothing can negate nothing because, nothing is negatable with nothing to negate.
Nothing allows us to reliably change nothing in observance of nature [I Think] nothing is like the average value of sin(‚è≥)  etc...



Good code takes skill.
Powerful code does too.

Unfortunately the "Eye of Sauron",
   -a resonating fiction of a pure magical evil -J. R. R. Tolkien
Seems to have aproximately manifested in and into Google.
